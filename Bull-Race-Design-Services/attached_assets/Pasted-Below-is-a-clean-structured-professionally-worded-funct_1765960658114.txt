Below is a **clean, structured, professionally worded functional requirements document** for your **Bull Race Management Application**.
I’ve reorganized, formatted, and rephrased the entire specification to make it suitable for design, development, or submission to Copilot/Figma/UI designers.

# **📘 Bull Race Management Application – Functional Requirements Document**

## **1. Overview**

The **Bull Race Management Application** is a responsive web platform built using **React + Bootstrap** with **Firebase** as backend.
The application manages Bull Race events that are conducted **sequentially category-by-category** and enables:

* Public users to **view race results, ongoing events, upcoming schedules**, and **register bull pairs**.
* Administrators to **configure categories**, **approve registrations**, **conduct races**, track **lap timings**, and **generate leaderboards**.

**No user authentication is required for public users.**
Admin access will be configured manually.

---

# **2. Core Modules**

## **2.1 Homepage**

A responsive landing page containing:

* **Photo Gallery Slider** (event images)
* **Live Race Information** (if any ongoing race)
* **Upcoming Race Schedule** (date, category, time)
* Quick navigation buttons:

  * Register Bull Pair
  * View Leaderboard
  * Historical Results

---

# **3. Category Management (Admin Only)**

Admins will create and manage race categories.

### **Category Fields**

* Category Type (Sub-Juniors / Juniors / Seniors / Super Seniors)
* Race Date
* Category Time (in minutes)
* Category Distance (meters per lap)
* Metadata: `createdBy`, `createdAt`, `modifiedBy`, `modifiedAt`

### **Rules**

* Categories define how a race will be executed.
* Races always run **sequentially** by category.

---

# **4. Bull Pair Registration**

### **Used by:**

* Public Users (online registration)
* Admins (on-spot registration)

### **Bull Pair Fields**

* Bull Pair Name
* Owner Names
* Phone Number
* Email (optional)
* Category Type
* Status: Pending → Approved/Rejected
* Metadata: `createdAt`, `modifiedBy`, `modifiedAt`

### **Process**

1. Owners register bull pairs online.
2. Admin reviews and updates status.
3. Approved pairs are added to the race pool.

---

# **5. Race Management (Admin Only)**

This module handles everything related to **conducting the race**.

### **5.1 Pre-Race Setup**

* Display all **approved pairs** in ascending registration order.
* Admin can **shuffle the order** to finalize race sequence (lucky draw).
* Once confirmed, race order is locked.

---

### **5.2 Running the Race (Pair-by-Pair)**

Each pair row contains:

* **Start Button** → Starts race timer for that pair.

Race UI includes:

* Stopwatch/timer
* Lap creation option
* Real-time time tracking

---

### **5.3 Lap Management**

When a lap is completed, Admin clicks **"Add Lap"**.

#### **Lap Fields:**

* Lap Number
* Distance Covered = (Category Distance × Lap Number)
* Lap Time (mm:ss)
* Total Time Until Lap
* Remaining Time (Category Time – Total Time)

#### **Special Functionality**

* Admin must be able to **override the final lap distance**:

  * Input format: **meters + feet + inches**
    Example: *100 meters, 1 foot, 4 inches*

---

### **5.4 Leaderboard Logic**

Leaderboard updates **automatically** based on lap timings.

#### **Sorting Rule**

* Compare timings **lap-by-lap**.
* Pair with **less time** at any lap is ahead.
* Order dynamically adjusts as each lap completes.

##### **Example**

Pair 1 laps: 10s → 15s → 5s
Pair 2 laps: 7s → 20s → 25s

* After Lap 1 → Pair 2 leads by 3s
* After Lap 2 → Pair 1 leads by 2s
* Leaderboard updates accordingly.

---

# **6. Live Race Results (Public Read-Only)**

Normal users can view:

* Ongoing race status
* Current lap performance
* Live leaderboard (auto-updated)
* Upcoming races with date & time

All information shown **in order of current ranking**.

---
